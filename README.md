# fitbit_data_analysis_by_Arjunhalli
I have taken the fitbit data from kaggle from there only I have analysed the data, the data contains the 367 days of activity and calories burnt on the each day with different activity like slow activity, moderate activity, etc,
by this data total activity in day is calculated and plotted the graph  of day vs calories and calories vs total activity in a day,
and mean, maximum, and minimum of calories is calculated and data set is  modified at end in terms of ascending order of calories
burnt in a day which help in knowing on which day calories burnt is a maximum by a person.
